#Time difference

#Open a business in Toronto Canada
Before talking about business, it is important to clarify that one category is aimed directly at investment and another at company creation, two different concepts regarding immigration to Canada.

There are two investment programs, one through the province of Quebec where the candidate must have a minimum wealth of 1.6 million dollars and deliver to the government, through an investment fund, 800 thousand dollars that will be returned to him in 5 years without interest or making a payment of around $ 240,000 that will not be refunded. The second program is Federal and for this the minimum required equity is 10 million and the required investment is 2 million that will be placed in a risk investment fund. The result of the investment will be reimbursed to the candidate after 15 years.

Regarding business programs, the Federal is known as “independent workers”. This program does not have a minimum investment requirement, but it does have a minimum score requirement that must be obtained in a qualification table, which, although it is not difficult to achieve as an initial requirement, does not guarantee that the candidate will be approved. This program is for candidates who have experience as freelancers in the cultural or sports sector, who have been internationally renowned athletes or artists, or who have experience managing farms.

Almost all provinces and territories have their own business program. With the exception of Nunavut, which has no provincial nomination program, New Brunswick which is currently not receiving applications under the business category, and Newfoundland and Labrador, which does not have a business category; all the other provinces have business programs.

Although each province has specific equity and investment requirements for its business program, there are common requirements for all, such as having experience as a business owner or as a senior manager in a company, that the heritage has been legally acquired and that the candidate is living legally in the country where he resides. As these are provincial nomination programs, they all in one way or another require that the candidate who is selected reside in the province that selected them and start their business there that must meet certain job creation requirements for Canadian residents or citizens. Almost all provinces expect that the candidate for nomination through the business program will first come to the province under a work permit and set up the business before giving the provincial nomination, and this only if the candidate has fulfilled, in the stipulated times, with the agreements reached with the province based on the business plan presented by the candidate.

The amounts of patrimony and investment vary depending on the province. The lowest equity and investment requirements are held by Northwest Territories under the category of businesses that will be established outside the Corporate Yellowknife region. The requirements in this category are $ 250,000 of equity and $ 150,000 of investment.

Under provincial nomination programs, it is common to find types of businesses that are not allowed, so it is important to check these lists before starting any type of process. Likewise, the vast majority of provinces require the candidate to make an exploratory visit before presenting their project.

Free trade agreements with Mexico, USA, Chile, Colombia and Peru also have provisions for investors or merchants. The main requirement is that the exchange of goods and services is made between the two countries (Canada and the treaty country through which the request is being made) and that there is a direct relationship between the company in Canada and the signatory country of the treaty. The investment amounts are not defined and although they can be of any amount, the investment must be significant. The difference between investment and business programs through provincial nomination and those of free trade agreements is that nominations and investment programs lead to permanent residence, while programs through free trade agreements, if well they are a step, they do not guarantee the obtaining of the permanent residence.

Business programs are definitely a very good option for those with experience as entrepreneurs or in senior management positions. The possibilities are vast and worth exploring.

#Start an office in New York
Historian James Truslow Adams first expressed the famous concept The American Dream in 1931. Since then, the prospect of success under the same opportunities as any American citizen has flooded the heads of millions of immigrants. Although it is true that, strictly speaking, this idea had already begun to be instilled in the English pioneers of the 16th and 17th centuries, in order to populate the British colonies of North America.

It appeared when the concept appeared, nowadays it has lost value. The reason? More and more immigrants have failed in their attempt to achieve a prominent position in the United States for not having the same opportunities as native citizens. Still, succeeding in the country is possible. Of course, starting your own business is, on many occasions, more viable than through a contract.

“Getting a work visa is extremely difficult; if you start your own project, the procedures are more feasible because the Government understands that you are the one generating your job position ”, explains Paz Sintes, from Barcelona, ​​designer and head of the eponymous jewelry firm. Her pieces, made of high-quality fabric, are considered works of art in the United States and have even captivated Queen Letizia. However, to succeed, as Sintes says, you need to leave your skin. “At first, you kill yourself; And you never really relax, because if you do, you risk losing what you have achieved in a very short time. But if you have a clear passion and believe in what you do, it is possible ”, he comments.

Why do it in New York? Armando Prados, CEO of the Aire Ancient Baths spa group, is clear: “It is the first city in the world. If you manage to succeed, you have the certainty that you will be able to do it anywhere in the world because the diffusion it brings you is enormous ”. However, as Prados points out, getting to start a business is not an easy task. “If you try to do it the Spanish way, you will fail; You have to completely change your mindset and, above all, have professional advice. It is an expensive service, but, in the end, it comes out cheap, ”says the businessman forcefully. Obtaining permits is one of the most complicated procedures for your group. “They demand licenses for everything. Among our services we offer a wine bath that is accompanied by a glass and, for this, we had to request an alcohol authorization. I even had to report my wife's eye color! ”He exclaims. Other drawbacks he mentions are the high turnover of personnel: “In Spain you train your employees and you are almost certain that they will be with you for an average of two years; in New York they can leave after 15 days ”.

To start a business in New York, as in any part of the world, it is essential to write a business plan, choose the location and request financing, suggests the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in New York. Then define your legal structure and register your business name. After that, you will need to apply for a tax identification number, worker's compensation, unemployment and disability insurance. In general, ask for all necessary licenses depending on the type of business. And it is essential to understand the responsibilities that you will have as an employer and employer.

Another notable case is that of the cook Lolo Manso. It has three restaurants in Manhattan: the Socarrats and La Churrería. Manso does not hesitate to encourage other chefs to open their business in the city: “If you have confidence in your product, there is always room for success. There is room for everyone here if three rules are followed: work, work and work ”. The businessman does not miss the opportunity to send a message to Spanish politicians: “If they want the Spain brand to succeed, they must do so through its gastronomy. Opening cooking schools around the world is a measure that would make our product and our country known ”, he concludes.

#LEGAL FORMS OF BUSINESSES IN THE USA
In the US there are four types of companies, which in turn may contain different variations, according to the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in that country.

Unique property. It requires few requirements. The owner assumes all financial and operational responsibility. The person's assets are linked to those of the company, so the owner assumes all risks.

Corporation. They are entities independent of their owners. Shareholders are protected from the obligations and responsibilities generated by the company. At the tax level, there are two types: C and S. The C are the responsibility of the company, while the S have no tax obligations.

Limited liability company. Combination of corporation and limited partnership. Owners control shares and their responsibility for company operations depends on the percentage of titles they control. Taxes are borne individually by the shareholders.

Limited society. Formed by two people or entities to own and manage the company. The partners share profits, losses and the management of the firm. Taxes are also the individual responsibility of the partners.
