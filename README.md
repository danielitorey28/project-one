#Time difference
Within the two cities, they have the same hours, they have no difference between them.

#Open a business in Toronto Canada
Before talking about business, it is important to clarify that one category is aimed directly at investment and another at company creation, two different concepts regarding immigration to Canada.

There are two investment programs, one through the province of Quebec where the candidate must have a minimum wealth of 1.6 million dollars and deliver to the government, through an investment fund, 800 thousand dollars that will be returned to him in 5 years without interest or making a payment of around $ 240,000 that will not be refunded. The second program is Federal and for this the minimum required equity is 10 million and the required investment is 2 million that will be placed in a risk investment fund. The result of the investment will be reimbursed to the candidate after 15 years.

Regarding business programs, the Federal is known as “independent workers”. This program does not have a minimum investment requirement, but it does have a minimum score requirement that must be obtained in a qualification table, which, although it is not difficult to achieve as an initial requirement, does not guarantee that the candidate will be approved. This program is for candidates who have experience as freelancers in the cultural or sports sector, who have been internationally renowned athletes or artists, or who have experience managing farms.

Almost all provinces and territories have their own business program. With the exception of Nunavut, which has no provincial nomination program, New Brunswick which is currently not receiving applications under the business category, and Newfoundland and Labrador, which does not have a business category; all the other provinces have business programs.

Although each province has specific equity and investment requirements for its business program, there are common requirements for all, such as having experience as a business owner or as a senior manager in a company, that the heritage has been legally acquired and that the candidate is living legally in the country where he resides. As these are provincial nomination programs, they all in one way or another require that the candidate who is selected reside in the province that selected them and start their business there that must meet certain job creation requirements for Canadian residents or citizens. Almost all provinces expect that the candidate for nomination through the business program will first come to the province under a work permit and set up the business before giving the provincial nomination, and this only if the candidate has fulfilled, in the stipulated times, with the agreements reached with the province based on the business plan presented by the candidate.

The amounts of patrimony and investment vary depending on the province. The lowest equity and investment requirements are held by Northwest Territories under the category of businesses that will be established outside the Corporate Yellowknife region. The requirements in this category are $ 250,000 of equity and $ 150,000 of investment.

Under provincial nomination programs, it is common to find types of businesses that are not allowed, so it is important to check these lists before starting any type of process. Likewise, the vast majority of provinces require the candidate to make an exploratory visit before presenting their project.

Free trade agreements with Mexico, USA, Chile, Colombia and Peru also have provisions for investors or merchants. The main requirement is that the exchange of goods and services is made between the two countries (Canada and the treaty country through which the request is being made) and that there is a direct relationship between the company in Canada and the signatory country of the treaty. The investment amounts are not defined and although they can be of any amount, the investment must be significant. The difference between investment and business programs through provincial nomination and those of free trade agreements is that nominations and investment programs lead to permanent residence, while programs through free trade agreements, if well they are a step, they do not guarantee the obtaining of the permanent residence.

Business programs are definitely a very good option for those with experience as entrepreneurs or in senior management positions. The possibilities are vast and worth exploring.

#Start an office in New York
Historian James Truslow Adams first expressed the famous concept The American Dream in 1931. Since then, the prospect of success under the same opportunities as any American citizen has flooded the heads of millions of immigrants. Although it is true that, strictly speaking, this idea had already begun to be instilled in the English pioneers of the 16th and 17th centuries, in order to populate the British colonies of North America.

It appeared when the concept appeared, nowadays it has lost value. The reason? More and more immigrants have failed in their attempt to achieve a prominent position in the United States for not having the same opportunities as native citizens. Still, succeeding in the country is possible. Of course, starting your own business is, on many occasions, more viable than through a contract.

“Getting a work visa is extremely difficult; if you start your own project, the procedures are more feasible because the Government understands that you are the one generating your job position ”, explains Paz Sintes, from Barcelona, ​​designer and head of the eponymous jewelry firm. Her pieces, made of high-quality fabric, are considered works of art in the United States and have even captivated Queen Letizia. However, to succeed, as Sintes says, you need to leave your skin. “At first, you kill yourself; And you never really relax, because if you do, you risk losing what you have achieved in a very short time. But if you have a clear passion and believe in what you do, it is possible ”, he comments.

Why do it in New York? Armando Prados, CEO of the Aire Ancient Baths spa group, is clear: “It is the first city in the world. If you manage to succeed, you have the certainty that you will be able to do it anywhere in the world because the diffusion it brings you is enormous ”. However, as Prados points out, getting to start a business is not an easy task. “If you try to do it the Spanish way, you will fail; You have to completely change your mindset and, above all, have professional advice. It is an expensive service, but, in the end, it comes out cheap, ”says the businessman forcefully. Obtaining permits is one of the most complicated procedures for your group. “They demand licenses for everything. Among our services we offer a wine bath that is accompanied by a glass and, for this, we had to request an alcohol authorization. I even had to report my wife's eye color! ”He exclaims. Other drawbacks he mentions are the high turnover of personnel: “In Spain you train your employees and you are almost certain that they will be with you for an average of two years; in New York they can leave after 15 days ”.

To start a business in New York, as in any part of the world, it is essential to write a business plan, choose the location and request financing, suggests the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in New York. Then define your legal structure and register your business name. After that, you will need to apply for a tax identification number, worker's compensation, unemployment and disability insurance. In general, ask for all necessary licenses depending on the type of business. And it is essential to understand the responsibilities that you will have as an employer and employer.

Another notable case is that of the cook Lolo Manso. It has three restaurants in Manhattan: the Socarrats and La Churrería. Manso does not hesitate to encourage other chefs to open their business in the city: “If you have confidence in your product, there is always room for success. There is room for everyone here if three rules are followed: work, work and work ”. The businessman does not miss the opportunity to send a message to Spanish politicians: “If they want the Spain brand to succeed, they must do so through its gastronomy. Opening cooking schools around the world is a measure that would make our product and our country known ”, he concludes.

#LEGAL FORMS OF BUSINESSES IN THE USA
In the US there are four types of companies, which in turn may contain different variations, according to the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in that country.

Unique property. It requires few requirements. The owner assumes all financial and operational responsibility. The person's assets are linked to those of the company, so the owner assumes all risks.

Corporation. They are entities independent of their owners. Shareholders are protected from the obligations and responsibilities generated by the company. At the tax level, there are two types: C and S. The C are the responsibility of the company, while the S have no tax obligations.

Limited liability company. Combination of corporation and limited partnership. Owners control shares and their responsibility for company operations depends on the percentage of titles they control. Taxes are borne individually by the shareholders.

Limited society. Formed by two people or entities to own and manage the company. The partners share profits, losses and the management of the firm. Taxes are also the individual responsibility of the partners.


## Current problem in the year 2020 with COVID-19

After giving an introduction to each of the cities, I can dictate the problem that is being experienced today by COVID-19.

TORONTO
Whoever does not comply with social distancing will be fined in Toronto, Canada for Covid-19
Mayor John Tory said citizens have been repeatedly warned that deliberate disobedience must be ended amid the coronavirus pandemic.
CANADA.- Anyone walking less than 1.80 meters (six feet) from another in a park or public square in Toronto could be fined up to C $ 5,000 (US $ 3,536), authorities said Thursday.

Mayor John Tory said citizens have been repeatedly warned that deliberate disobedience must be ended amid the coronavirus pandemic.


Lives are at risk, and we will take stricter measures in the hope that the few who don't understand them, or pretend they don't understand them, will stick to the program, "said Tory.

Tory noted that the problems are currently reported in parks and public spaces. He specified that people who do not live together need to be apart. People from the same family are exempt from the measure.

The mayor indicated that, if it becomes a problem on sidewalks or other places, they will attend to it later. The new guidelines will remain in effect for the next 30 days.

Tory said she does not want Toronto, Canada's most populous city, to become New York, which has been the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.

NEW YORK
Coronavirus: the covid-19 drama in New York, a city with crowded morgues and field hospitals

Philip Tassi warns that the cemetery where he works is overflowing with orders, but there is no time for breaks here: the New York government has just announced that between Monday and Tuesday there was a new record of 731 deaths from the coronavirus in the state.

"The number of burial and cremation requests we have is probably up 300%," says Tassi of the Ferncliff cemetery in Westchester, just a few miles north of Manhattan.

Up to 20 bodies now pass through this crematorium in 16-hour working hours, seven days a week. But even so, operating at maximum capacity, the schedule is full until the end of next week.

History repeats itself elsewhere in New York, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, the country with the most confirmed cases of covid-19 in the world.

"Most cemeteries don't have refrigeration units for a pandemic. So the biggest problem now is that we don't have refrigerated storage to keep bodies here for long periods," says Tassi, who chairs the State Cemetery Association of New York and has been working in the sector for 23 years.

Funeral homes are also overwhelmed, and authorities have sent dozens of mobile morgues or refrigerated trailers to hospitals and other parts of the city to prevent corpses from accumulating without a place to receive them, as has happened in other countries hit by the virus.

The Guayaquil drama, which has more coronavirus deaths than entire countries and fights against the clock to give them a decent burial
"I have never seen anything like this in my entire life, this many people who can die in such a short period," Tassi tells BBC Mundo. "Not even on 9/11 did we have the number of bodies you have with this," he says, referring to the 2001 attacks in the city.

## WORLD LEVEL WITH RESTAURANT BUSINESSES BY COVID-19

Coronavirus and restaurants: preventive measures and economic prospects of the COVID-19 crisis

The Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) is one of the many viruses in the Coronaviridae family that affects birds, and various mammals such as hedgehogs, pangolins, and bats. When they break the border between animals and humans, people usually present more or less severe respiratory symptoms.

The coronavirus that concerns us has a great contagion capacity, but the disorders it causes are rather mild. Proof of this is that the average profile of deaths is that of an octogenarian with previous health problems.

Although, the lightness of the cases should not be misleading. If the number of infections becomes very high, so will the death toll. And if the peak of coronavirus cases is reached too quickly, the national health system will not be able to cope with all critical cases. Hence, prevention, containment and elimination measures are essential. Even more so when we know little about the organism in question.

As the situation in Wuhan and Hubei (China) stabilizes and the number of new daily cases reported peaks, a clear indicator that the situation has been brought under control, it is Europe's turn to demonstrate that it can take appropriate measures to end the crisis.

The country

Italy was the first country to face a difficult situation. Currently, with the entire nation in quarantine, it serves as a benchmark for what can reach France and Germany, and also Spain, of course.

In just a few days we have witnessed notable changes in the way the problem was being managed in our country. From one day to the next Madrid and La Rioja have canceled classes, and in the capital social events have been canceled or suppressed up to a third of their initial capacity. The Madrid stock exchange has also suffered the biggest crash in its history.

Similar measures are expected to be imported into other autonomous communities. It is not a matter of scaremongering, the scenarios have changed and therefore the performances must change.

But ... What does all this mean for the restaurant professional and in the hospitality world? You don't have to dig to see that there is little good news. However, for all those businesses that seek normality, in this article we will clearly explain the current circumstances in the sector and what measures need to be taken in the workplace to guarantee the well-being of workers and customers.

Contraction of economic activity in restaurants and hospitality businesses
It did not take panic for demand in restaurants and hotels to drop. The most affordable precaution for the general population is self-imposed confinement. Even when it is not total, the first thing to sacrifice is everything that does not represent a vital need. And going out to eat is not a matter of life or death.

When the first cases were released in the Spanish Levante, the impact of the news had little impact. Some Valencian restaurants such as the Honoo, the Tonyina or the Bodega Anyora carried out their activity with total normality, pending in any case the news that came from the Valencia Hospitality Business Federation (FEHV), especially those that materialized in the form of protocols specific.

Despite the first cases, everything was going as usual. However, the cancellation of one of the most important consumer electronics fairs on the planet, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, ​​raised the alarm on everyone's lips.

According to the Mirai reservation portal, which is trusted by more than 1,500 hotel brands, "The cancellation of the Mobile World Congress acted as a speaker over Spain: from then on, we noticed drops in conversion."

The cancellation of this event has splashed many other industries, and of course also the world of gastronomy. The celebration of the Alimentaria-Hostelco fair in Barcelona and the Salón Gourmets in Madrid have been postponed. Luckily and for the moment, they are only postponed, those interested can attend between September 14 and 17 in the case of the event based in Catalonia, and between June 15 and 18 when we talk about the room.

That same uncertainty is what has caused a critical period for restaurants in terms of billing to be completely disrupted. In spring, around 30% of the total turnover for the year is generated, but this 2020 promises to be different.

Large cities depend on tourism to place their offer of services, and with the influx of tourists in question, there are no good prospects. In cities like Seville, there could be a 60% drop in foreign tourism, vital for the city. The cancellations of Chinese and Italian travelers are now joined by those of Americans and other European citizens.

Seville has also been hit by the cancellation of scientific and professional conferences. Companies and institutions are the first to want to protect their human resources, especially when it comes to highly qualified workers.

The situation, from the first moment, has been negative. A freezing of the reserves is foreseen that will last for a period of several months and could be accused if the Easter processions and other typical festivals of these dates end up being canceled.

According to Antonio Luque, president of the Hoteliers Association, "we are on the verge of starting the high season and if fewer tourists come, we will have a hard time."

And everything points to the fact that the Easter congregations will be effectively canceled. As has already happened with the Venice Carnivals, sporting events or the Fallas. While in Italy a 60% drop in hotel and restaurant reservations was observed, in Spain a different situation is forecast: reservations are already made (some establishments were at 90% occupancy), but now a wave of cancellations will come which will approach 80% of the total.

Wealthy Chinese tourists do not come, and now the arrival of French and Germans, who form the bulk of Spanish tourism, is not expected either. "Giving a negative view of the sector is increasing the problem," emphasizes the current president of the Las Palmas Hospitality and Tourism Federation, José María Mañaricúa; But it is difficult not to join this fear when all the data points in the same direction: giants from the hospitality sector such as AC Hotels and NH have already put opportunities on the table for workers to take advantage of a vacation plan now, an attempt to mitigation to mitigate the economic losses derived from the coronavirus outbreak. And the rumors of temporary ERE are already in the air ...

The public health problem associated with the new virus not only causes financial problems from the point of view of customer relationships. Large organized catering brands have been forced to cancel strategic meetings. Denny’s has canceled an investor conference and at KFC they have received notice from parent company Yum Brands to avoid unnecessary travel.

In summary, these are the main fronts facing restaurants during these difficult times:

Wealthy tourism from China disappears
Tourism from Europe will critically decrease
Tourism from the US is expected. USA take a heavy hit in the coming weeks
About a third of local consumers will stop eating out due to the coronavirus
More than two thirds of local customers could stop visiting restaurants if the crisis worsens
The population is already changing its consumption habits to adapt to new circumstances
Food delivery services will be reinforced as long as their activity is not paralyzed.
Restaurants that base their business model on on-premise sales will receive the hardest hit
Fast food chains could benefit from the ideal circumstances to enhance their efforts to implement systems such as takeaways and home delivery of food.
What seems less likely is that attacks against Asian businesses will continue as the epidemic has reached the global stage.

In the first moments there were very questionable instances promoted by an underlying racism and the disinformation to which the population is subjected. When the cases in Wuhan were the talk of all, Chinese and Japanese restaurants in New York experienced sales 60% below normal.

In Spain, the media had to come to the aid of the Asian population residing in the country. And in France the situation was not very different, the Yuki restaurant in Paris, specialized in Japanese fusion food, dawned a day with graffiti alluding to the coronavirus.

The fears of the population have had to be allayed in some cases with the words of important personalities. In the USA USA the nervousness was such that former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, a Democratic party billionaire, had to allay voters' fears by saying he had plans to dine at a Chinese restaurant after ending the town meeting in which he was being interviewed by Fox News .

Even in East Asia, the Chinese have not escaped being judged without reason. In Hong Kong city, under siege by China's central government for months, some restaurants were refusing to serve mainland Chinese citizens. At least 100 restaurants were discovered doing these practices in research led by the Society for Community Organization (SoCO). Association spokesman Richard Tsoi Yiu-cheong commented in this regard that restaurants must be part of public health measures, but in the course of time they cannot take away or discriminate against citizens' rights.

Preventive measures to be implemented in the restaurant against coronavirus
Official agencies have been quick to make recommendations on health material. Hospitality of Spain has launched a series of infographics that summarize the most important actions, namely:

Installation of disinfectant gel dispensers available for workers and users of the establishment
Disinfection process of tableware and cutlery with temperatures above 80 degrees Celsius
Washing of table linen, napkins and work clothes at temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius
Cooking of food at temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius (coronavirus is not a foodborne disease, but cross-contamination may exist)
Preserve the cold chain and keep preserved foods physically protected at all times by containers
Limit customer handling and avoid sharing trousseau or food
Keep your distance, minimize physical contact, and wash your hands with soap and water frequently
Distance measures should be extreme when interlocutors show signs of suffering from a respiratory condition
Regularly clean areas that can be caught or used frequently

These measures are inherited from the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health. Elsewhere on the planet, official recommendations differ slightly. For example, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). USA further recommends that:

All personnel must know in detail the hygienic protocol, the chemical products used and the frequency with which they must be used.
The hand washing process must last at least 20 seconds and be carried out with bactericidal soap and hot water
The requirements regarding personal hygiene, those that take place outside the workplace, must be tightened
Employees should avoid touching their mucosa if it has been a long time since they last washed their hands.
If a worker is going to sneeze or cough, it is preferable that they do so in a disposable handkerchief, when this is not available they will do so on the fabric of their sleeve at the level of the forearm; the hand should not be used
The N95, N99 and P95 masks prevent the transmission of the coronavirus, its use may become justified in high-risk areas where there is also a high influx of customers.
Some large companies in the catering sector have already made changes to the way they work to reassure diners. This is the case of Starbucks, which has been operating in conflict zones in China and the United States. UU (specifically in Seattle).

Starbucks experienced a 78% drop in coffee sales in China during the month of February, and the second quarter does not seem very flattering, the volume of business is expected to be only 50% last year. All this despite the fact that 90% of its stores are operational.

The measures that Starbucks has taken are very similar to those already exposed, but the following should be noted:

All workers go through a daily control of body temperature and wear masks at all times
There is a pre-reception security station where customers are also tested to rule out fevers.
Establishment of the Contactless Starbucks Experience protocol that prevents contact between workers and customers
Improvement in the disinfection and sanitization processes of the ingredients, devices and tools involved in the preparation of coffee
The distribution of the tables has been distanced
McDonald’s has also been quick to adopt new measures to fight the coronavirus and minimize economic losses as much as possible. On the one hand, they have created an internal decision-making group in charge of everything related to the SARS-CoV-2, while in the premises soap dispensers have been installed in the kitchen and in the lobby, at the same time that it has been reinforced Cleaning.

One of the points that are least taken into consideration, however, is the delivery of information to the consumer. This is an aspect that must also be acted on, as the client is often the person who feels most vulnerable when he is submerged in the sea of ​​disinformation that is social networks and the media these days. Returning to normality can reactivate your daily consumption habits and have a better economic profile for the companies with which you interact.

And always, always, we must remember that stopping this epidemic is everyone's responsibility. We hope that with this article our readers will know what to expect and what steps to take depending on local circumstances at all times. In this way we have no doubt that they will be able to wish their diners not only good profit, but also good health.

## POSSIBLE SOLUTION BY COVID-19 IN RESTAURANTS WORLDWIDE

After the closure of the hospitality sector, at least, when it comes to eating on the premises, a new not very rosy panorama appears that restaurants will have to face to survive in the best way.

Make no mistake, the situation is not going to be easy. Despite the measures adopted by the Government to be able to pay the rents, not having to throw away a large part of the stock that we had or seeing how to appease the new situation of our workers, it will bring many headaches and adversities that will lead to the ruin many of today's businesses.

Therefore, from TheCookingClubster, we offer a series of recommendations to try to cushion the blow in the best way, and why not, take advantage of the situation.

TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEAM
Although now it may seem like a drag on your survival as a restaurant, the situation is not their fault, and only with good communication, sensible agreements, and clear management of the situation, can you reinforce your image as a leader so that everyone understands the need of fighting for a common goal.

STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH THE CURRENT
Government announcements or announcements regarding laws or economic measures are many and varied during this state of alarm, therefore being very up to date with all this news together with your labor, tax and accounting advisers will help you make the best decisions. in the shortest possible time.

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOURSELF AS A RESTAURANT
It is a good time to stop, even if it is an obligation, and analyze how your business is going. Take a kind of x-ray of the current situation of your project until before the crisis and adapt the business plan to the effects of it. Being forward-looking and analyzing the future is a good way not to go bankrupt along the way.

To help this self-analysis, keep an eye on our social networks @thecookingclubster since these days we will post a MINIGAP on our website: an analytical survey that will help you analyze where you are and what you can improve from your restaurant to increase billing , improve food, customer experience or online reputation. Before taking action it is important to know what action to take.

YOUR CLIENT IS ONLINE
Let's think it is a good time to dedicate to our online presence. Do we have adapted social networks? Do we have a powerful image in RRSS? What about our website? Is it up to date? Do we know what our target customers think of us? It is time to ask yourself these and many questions and put an end to them.

BE CREATIVE
They say that in periods of crisis the greatest opportunities arise, and it is true. It is a perfect time to get to know you better, to get to know you and to provide solutions to your customers who will thank you later as a brand. The brand value is not only the monthly billing.

At this time when the news shows people doing triathlon at home, new hundreds of kitchen channels, new “fit house”, or endless creative actions, think, how can we help our client? It is a good way to enter their lives and stay.
